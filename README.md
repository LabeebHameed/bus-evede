### Project Description
Imagine an app that combines public transit with package delivery, offering real-time bus schedules along with a convenient courier service. It lets commuters track bus arrivals and enables senders to track packages on those buses, making transportation and delivery fast and reliable.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding the time of the Bus that dosn't run and sending Packages that don't need to be sent

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Making an App that compiles the bus route-times in to a single app that has cool animations and an incredible UI also lets the user send Couriers through the app with a VERY COST FRIENDLY DELIVERY SYSTEM.
